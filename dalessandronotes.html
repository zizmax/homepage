<h1> Hey Bill </h1>
<h2> Quick facts: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Graduated Fall 2019 (Econ major, Cybersecurity minor)</li>
<li>Started 1st job at Deloitte as Cyber Analyst just over 6 months ago</li>
<li>I've had an entrepreneurial bent for as long as I can remember (selling comics in grade school, Bitcoin mining in middle school, and running a profitable Minecraft server in high school)</li>
<li>I love your take on the practicality of debt, and your "Business of You" class mirrors my own interests of applying strategy to your career and personal growth.</li>
<li>Last month I launched a web project at forgetalgebra.com that touches on a few of these themes</li>
<h2> Why I reached out: </h2>
  <ul>
<li>Think Like an Owner has been the podcast I never knew I needed. I've been tearing through it voraciously and your episode stood out immediately.</li>
<li>When you described how an SBA loan can be used for an ETA play my mind was blown!</li>
<li>I am convinced more and more every day that starting or buying a business will be a significant part of my future.</li>
<li>I would love to get your take on where to focus my efforts now in this early stage of wanting to construct a career similar to your own</li>
  </ul>
<h2> Specific questions: </h2>
  <ul>
<li>What are your 40 by 40? The webpage is a 404 and it's not on archive.org either</li>
<li>Is there anything you did (or didn't do) when you were just starting out that you'd recommend to others?</li>
<li>I'm trying to strategize my growth in this space. Essentially it comes down to (1) getting to know people (cold emails, using Twitter more), (2) learning how deals are done (Think Like an Owner and Acquisitions Anonymous), (3) trying my hand at some small operations with friends along the way (forgetalgebra.com is the first example). Is there anything you'd tweak about this strategy?</li>
</ul>
